## 📋 **Pre-Deployment Tasks**

### 🔧 **Environment Setup**
- [ ] Set `CRON_SECRET` for daily reset endpoint
- [ ] Configure `WOLFPACK_VIP_USERS` list
- [ ] Set up Redis for rate limiting (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Configure monitoring endpoints

### 🗃️ **Database Migrations**
- [ ] Verify all tables exist in production
- [ ] Run performance index creation during maintenance window
- [ ] Set up daily reset cron job at 2:30 AM PST

### 🔍 **Testing**
- [ ] Test location verification with real GPS coordinates
- [ ] Verify real-time subscriptions work under load
- [ ] Test VIP user bypass functionality
- [ ] Validate daily reset operation

### 📈 **Monitoring Setup**
- [ ] API response time monitoring
- [ ] Database query performance tracking
- [ ] Real-time connection monitoring
- [ ] Error rate alerting

## 🚀 **Deployment Steps**

### 1. **Pre-deployment**
```bash
# Run production build
npm run build

# Run type check
npm run type-check

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Verify environment variables
echo $CRON_SECRET
echo $WOLFPACK_VIP_USERS
```

### 2. **Database Preparation**
```sql
-- Create performance indexes (during maintenance window)
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_wolf-pack-members_location_status 
ON wolf-pack-members(location_id, status) WHERE status = 'active';

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_wolfpack_chat_messages_session_created 
ON wolfpack_chat_messages(session_id, created_at DESC);

-- Verify tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('wolf-pack-members', 'wolfpack_chat_messages', 'dj_events');
```

### 3. **Deploy Frontend**
```bash
# Deploy to production
npm run start

# Verify deployment
curl -f https://yourdomain.com/api/wolfpack/locations
```

### 4. **Post-deployment Verification**
- [ ] Location verification works
- [ ] Real-time chat functional
- [ ] DJ features operational
- [ ] Daily reset scheduled properly

## 🔍 **Health Checks**

### **Critical Endpoints**
- `GET /api/wolfpack/locations` - Location service
- `POST /api/wolfpack/join` - Membership service
- `GET /api/messages?session_id=test` - Chat service
- `GET /api/wolfpack/reset` - Reset status

### **Real-time Verification**
- Supabase connection established
- Channels subscribing properly
- Message delivery working
- Typing indicators functional

### **Performance Benchmarks**
- API response time < 200ms
- Real-time message latency < 100ms
