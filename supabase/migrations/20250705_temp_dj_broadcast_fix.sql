-- TEMPORARY FIX FOR DJ BROADCAST 403 ERRORS
-- Relax RLS policies for testing purposes
-- =====================================================

-- Drop the restrictive policy for DJ broadcasts
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "DJs can manage broadcasts" ON dj_broadcasts;

-- Create a more permissive policy for testing
-- Allow all authenticated users to create/manage broadcasts temporarily
CREATE POLICY "Temp - All authenticated users can manage broadcasts" ON dj_broadcasts
    FOR ALL USING (
        EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE auth_id = auth.uid())
    );

-- Also ensure DJ dashboard state is accessible
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "DJs can manage their dashboard state" ON dj_dashboard_state;
CREATE POLICY "Temp - Users can manage dashboard state" ON dj_dashboard_state
    FOR ALL USING (
        EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE auth_id = auth.uid())
    );

-- Allow users to create DJ events temporarily  
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "DJs can manage events" ON dj_events;
CREATE POLICY "Temp - Users can manage events" ON dj_events
    FOR ALL USING (
        EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE auth_id = auth.uid())
    );

-- Ensure broadcast templates are accessible
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "DJs can manage templates" ON dj_broadcast_templates;
CREATE POLICY "Temp - Users can manage templates" ON dj_broadcast_templates
    FOR ALL USING (
        EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE auth_id = auth.uid())
    );

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "DJs can view all templates" ON dj_broadcast_templates;
CREATE POLICY "Temp - Users can view templates" ON dj_broadcast_templates
    FOR SELECT USING (
        EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE auth_id = auth.uid())
    );

-- Event templates access
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "DJs can create templates" ON dj_event_templates;
CREATE POLICY "Temp - Users can create templates" ON dj_event_templates
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
        EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE auth_id = auth.uid())
    );

-- Analytics access
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "DJs can view their analytics" ON dj_analytics;
CREATE POLICY "Temp - Users can view analytics" ON dj_analytics
    FOR SELECT USING (
        EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE auth_id = auth.uid())
    );

-- Event participants
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "DJs can manage participants" ON dj_event_participants;
CREATE POLICY "Temp - Users can manage participants" ON dj_event_participants
    FOR ALL USING (
        EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE auth_id = auth.uid())
