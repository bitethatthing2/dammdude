#PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_DIRECTIVE
Before implementing ANY changes or suggestions:
1. DO NOT create new files unless absolutely necessary
2. ALWAYS check if similar files/functionality already exists ANYWHERE in the project
3. SEARCH the entire project tree for related files before suggesting new ones
4. CONSOLIDATE rather than duplicate - modify existing files where possible
5. CHECK DEVELOPER TOOLS for real-time errors and address them immediately
6. USE SUPABASE MCP TOOLS to verify database interactions and schema consistency
7. DOCUMENT any file changes or (if unavoidable) new file creation
8. MAINTAIN a single source of truth for each functionality
9. FOLLOW our established folder structure and naming conventions
10. VERIFY your changes won't create path conflicts or circular dependencies
11. PRIORITIZE mobile-first responsive design throughout all components
12. UTILIZE error logs and developer console to diagnose and fix issues in real-time

Remember: Our development process should be fast, smooth, and error-free through proactive monitoring and immediate correction of issues using our dev tools and Supabase MCP tools.
