### 1. **Replace Existing Components (5 minutes)**

```bash
# DJ Dashboard - Replace immediately for staff productivity
mv components/dj/DJDashboard.tsx components/dj/DJDashboard-original.tsx
mv components/dj/DJDashboard-optimized.tsx components/dj/DJDashboard.tsx

# Event Creator - Critical fix for event persistence
mv components/dj/EventCreator.tsx components/dj/EventCreator-original.tsx
mv components/dj/EventCreator-optimized.tsx components/dj/EventCreator.tsx

# WolfpackMembersList - Member experience enhancement
mv components/wolfpack/WolfpackMembersList.tsx components/wolfpack/WolfpackMembersList-original.tsx
mv components/wolfpack/WolfpackMembersList-optimized.tsx components/wolfpack/WolfpackMembersList.tsx

# Menu - Restaurant operations optimization
mv components/menu/Menu.tsx components/menu/Menu-original.tsx
mv components/menu/Menu-optimized.tsx components/menu/Menu.tsx
```

### 2. **Verify Service Dependencies (2 minutes)**

Ensure these service files are in place:
- âœ… `/lib/services/error-service.ts`
- âœ… `/lib/services/data-service.ts`
- âœ… `/lib/services/auth-service.ts`
