# BarTap System Update: Fixing Cookie and Database Relationship Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Cookie Handling in Next.js

The application was encountering errors related to synchronous cookie access in Next.js:

```
Error: Route "/api/admin/orders" used `cookies().get('sb-dzvvjgmnlcmgrsnyfqnw-auth-token.1')`. 
`cookies()` should be awaited before using its value.
```

**Solution:**
- Created a new `server-fixed.ts` file with properly awaited cookie handling
- Updated the Supabase server client to use async methods for all cookie operations
- Removed the cookie caching mechanism that was causing issues

```typescript
// New implementation with proper async handling
async get(name: string) {
  try {
    // Use await to ensure all cookie operations are async
    return (await cookieJar.get(name))?.value;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error getting cookie:', name, error);
    return undefined;
  }
}
```

### 2. Database Foreign Key Relationships

The application was encountering foreign key relationship errors:

```
Database query failed: {
  code: 'PGRST200',
  details: "Searched for a foreign key relationship between 'orders' and 'tables' in the schema 'public', but no matches were found.",
  hint: null,
  message: "Could not find a relationship between 'orders' and 'tables' in the schema cache"
}
```

**Solution:**
- Modified the API endpoint to avoid table joins until migrations are applied
- Implemented a two-step query approach to fetch orders and tables separately
- Created fallback mechanisms for table names when relationships aren't available

```typescript
// Simplified query without table joins
let query = supabase.from('orders')
  .select(`
    id, 
    table_id,
    status, 
    created_at, 
    updated_at,
    total_amount,
    notes
  `);

// Fetch table names separately
if (data && data.length > 0) {
  const tableIds = Array.from(new Set(data.map(order => order.table_id)));
  
  try {
    const { data: tableData } = await supabase
      .from('tables')
      .select('id, name')
      .in('id', tableIds);
      
    // Create a lookup map for table names
    if (tableData) {
      tableNamesMap = tableData.reduce((acc, table) => {
        acc[table.id] = table.name;
        return acc;
      }, {});
    }
  } catch (tableError) {
    // Continue without table names if there's an error
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Apply the database migration script to establish proper relationships

2. Move from the transitional `server-fixed.ts` approach to a more permanent solution

3. Update all other API endpoints to use the new approach

4. Test the system with real data to ensure all relationships are working correctly

5. Complete the implementation of the unified components once the database issues are resolved

## Long-term Recommendations

1. **Database Schema Management**: 
   - Use a schema migration tool to track and apply changes consistently
   - Add validation to ensure foreign keys are properly established

2. **Cookie Handling**: 
   - Standardize on a single pattern for cookie access across the application
   - Add retry mechanisms for cookie-related operations

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement more robust error boundaries in components
   - Add telemetry to track and alert on database relationship issues

Once these immediate fixes are implemented and tested, we can continue with the broader refactoring outlined in the SOLUTION.md file.
